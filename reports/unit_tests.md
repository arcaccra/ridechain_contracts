# Unit Test Report â€“ Escrow Smart Contract

## Introduction
This report details the unit testing performed on the locking and unlocking scripts of the Escrow Smart Contract. The primary objective was to verify the correctness, reliability, and clarity of outputs for both the lock and unlock functionalities. The tests ensure that funds can be securely locked and released under the defined contract conditions, and that all actions are appropriately logged.

## Test Environment
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Testing Framework**: pytest
- **Mocks**: Used to simulate Cardano blockchain context and contract interactions
- **File Handling**: Temporary directories created for CSV log writing and validation

## Test Cases Executed

| Test Case ID | Description | Expected Outcome | Actual Outcome | Result |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|---------------|--------|
| TC-LOCK-001  | Lock funds with valid amount (happy path) | Funds are locked, CSV updated, success message | As expected | Pass |
| TC-LOCK-002  | Lock funds with different valid amounts | Funds are locked for all tested amounts, CSV reflects each | As expected | Pass |
| TC-LOCK-003  | Lock funds writes correct CSV log | CSV contains correct UTxO, amount, and timestamp | As expected | Pass |
| TC-LOCK-004  | Lock funds with invalid input (e.g., negative amount) | Error raised, no CSV written | As expected | Pass |
| TC-LOCK-005  | Lock funds with file system error (CSV unwritable) | Error handled gracefully, user informed | As expected | Pass |
| TC-UNLOCK-001| Unlock funds with valid UTxO and redeemer (happy path) | Funds released, CSV updated, success message | As expected | Pass |
| TC-UNLOCK-002| Unlock funds logs action to CSV | CSV log contains unlock action, correct fields | As expected | Pass |
| TC-UNLOCK-003| Unlock with incorrect UTxO reference | Error raised, funds not released | As expected | Pass |
| TC-UNLOCK-004| Unlock with invalid redeemer | Error raised, CSV unchanged | As expected | Pass |

## Summary of Results
All 9 test cases executed successfully. There were no failures or unexpected behaviors. This represents a 100% pass rate for the current suite of unit tests.

## Key Findings
- Locking and unlocking scripts correctly handle dynamic and edge-case amounts.
- All actions are reliably logged to CSV, ensuring traceability and auditability.
- The code maintains clear separation of concerns between business logic and logging.
- Error conditions (such as invalid input or file errors) are managed gracefully, with appropriate user feedback.

## Recommendations
- Add additional negative test cases to cover more edge scenarios.
- Develop integration tests using a Cardano testnet to validate end-to-end contract behavior.
- Expand CSV logging tests to include validation of log integrity over multiple operations.

## Conclusion
The unit tests confirm that the escrow contract's locking and unlocking scripts function correctly, reliably handle various scenarios, and provide clear, auditable outputs. The implementation is ready for further integration and deployment steps.
